Cleartext Transmission - HTTP Instead of HTTPS

import { serveStatic } from "./static";
import { createServer } from "http";

const app = express();
const httpServer = createServer(app);
http.createServer uses HTTP which is an insecure protocol and should not be used in code due to cleartext transmission of information. Data in cleartext in a communication channel can be sniffed by unauthorized actors. Consider using the https module instead.

      }

      // This sets the cookie to keep the sidebar state.
      document.cookie = `${SIDEBAR_COOKIE_NAME}=${openState}; path=/; max-age=${SIDEBAR_COOKIE_MAX_AGE}`
Cookie misses the Secure attribute (it is false by default). Set it to true to protect the cookie from man-in-the-middle attacks.
