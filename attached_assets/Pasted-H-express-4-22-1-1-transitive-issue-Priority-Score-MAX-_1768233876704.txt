Fix: Your dependencies are out of date, otherwise you would be using a newer qs than qs@6.13.0. Try relocking your lockfile or deleting node_modules. If the problem persists, one of your dependencies may be bundling outdated modules.

Overview
qs is a querystring parser that supports nesting and arrays, with a depth limit.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling via improper enforcement of the arrayLimit option in bracket notation parsing. An attacker can exhaust server memory and cause application unavailability by submitting a large number of bracket notation parameters - like a[]=1&a[]=2 - in a single HTTP request.

    vi.resetAllMocks();

    consoleErrorSpy = vi.spyOn(console, 'error').mockImplementation(() => {});
    
    app = express();
Disable X-Powered-By header for your Express app (consider using Helmet middleware), because it exposes information about the used framework to potential attackers.

Cleartext Transmission - HTTP Instead of HTTPS

    consoleErrorSpy = vi.spyOn(console, 'error').mockImplementation(() => {});
    
    app = express();
    app.use(express.json());
    httpServer = createServer(app);
http.createServer uses HTTP which is an insecure protocol and should not be used in code due to cleartext transmission of information. Data in cleartext in a communication channel can be sniffed by unauthorized actors. Consider using the https module instead.
